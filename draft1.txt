Somewhere, the boundary of the eye and what is seen has been lost, because I am not in the feed. I am the feed. I don't know what I know anymore, I just know how to find it. I am a catalogue, not a library, linked into the network symbiotically. Can I preserve myself outside the network? Or will my mind end, another I emerge that is not this person who is absorbed in the gleaming hypersonic chrome of the millenial generation?
