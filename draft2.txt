Somewhere in this monitor's mirage, I lose track of the boundary between my eye and what I see. I am not reading the newsfeed; I am the newsfeed. My memory is a catalogue, not a library -- referencing what the web contains, but containing nothing but references. Am I anything outside the gleaming hypersonic chrome of the millennial generation?
